# customhasssynology

This repository spawned out of the requirement to make an update to the Synology DMS integration, which the main integraiton would not be able to support see ticket: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/126921

This script simply:
1. Makes a copy of the latest integraiton from the HA Core repo
2. Modifies it with the required changes
3. Once published it can be used in HACS
